This repository contains code for Jennifer Kahn’s WDI Project 1, a self-scoring trivia game designed to test a user’s knowledge of popular movie quotes.The inspiration for this game came from my love of cinema. The movie lines were taken from a list of frequently quoted films.

Approach: After pseudo-coding logic for a self-scoring trivia game, I went ahead of drew some sketches for a wireframe. I then attempted to code this out via javascript, HTML, CSS, JQuery.

I learned so much this week. Looking back, I was too ambitious and should have stuck to the basic requirements. In any case, I am happy that the basic logic of my game is visible.

Another lesson I learned is that if something is up and actually works, for this project at least, leave it be! I ended up confusing myself and should not have dealt with some of the styling issues, i believed i had. My lack of CSS styling and disorganization caused the player 2 button and the timer icon to fail as of date. I am very happy to say that the working ‘logic’ of the game and self-scoring aspect is up and running. If I had more time, I would spend it in a number of ways. I am so grateful for all of the guidance I received from instructors and look forward to growing and 'developing' over the next few months!
